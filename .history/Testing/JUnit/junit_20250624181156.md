### Q: What is JUnit and why is it used?

**A:**  
JUnit is a widely used testing framework for Java applications. It provides annotations and assertions to help developers write and run repeatable tests, ensuring code quality and facilitating test-driven development (TDD).

### Q: How do you create a simple test case in JUnit?

**A:**  
To create a test case in JUnit, you need to:
1. Add the JUnit dependency to your project.
2. Create a test class annotated with `@RunWith(JUnit4.class)`.
3. Write test methods annotated with `@Test`.

Example:
```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class MyTests {
    @Test
    public void testAddition() {
        assertEquals(2, 1 + 1);
    }
}
```

### Q: What are some common JUnit annotations?

**A:**  
- `@Test`: Marks a method as a test method.
- `@Before`: Runs before each test method.
- `@After`: Runs after each test method.
- `@BeforeClass`: Runs once before any test methods in the class.
- `@AfterClass`: Runs once after all test methods in the class.

### Q: How do you assert values in JUnit tests?

**A:**  
JUnit provides various assertion methods in the `Assert` class to check expected values against actual values. Common assertions include:
- `assertEquals(expected, actual)`: Checks if two values are equal.
- `assertTrue(condition)`: Checks if a condition is true.
- `assertFalse(condition)`: Checks if a condition is false.
- `assertNull(object)`: Checks if an object is null.
- `assertNotNull(object)`: Checks if an object is not null.

### Q: How do you handle exceptions in JUnit tests?

**A:**  
You can use the `@Test(expected = Exception.class)` annotation to specify that a test method is expected to throw a particular exception. Alternatively, you can use a try-catch block within the test method and fail the test if the exception is not thrown.

Example:
```java
@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void testInvalidArgument() {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException();
}
```

---

### Q: Can you run JUnit tests from the command line?

**A:**  
Yes, you can run JUnit tests from the command line using build tools like Maven or Gradle. For example, with Maven, you can use the command `mvn test` to run all tests in the project.

---

### Q: How can you organize JUnit tests in a project?

**A:**  
JUnit tests are typically organized in a separate directory (e.g., `src/test/java`) within the project structure. You can create packages that mirror the main application structure to keep tests organized and maintainable.

---

### Q: What is the purpose of test suites in JUnit?

**A:**  
Test suites allow you to group multiple test classes and run them together. You can create a test suite by using the `@Suite` annotation and specifying the test classes to include.

Example:
```java
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.junit.runners.Suite;

@RunWith(Suite.class)
@Suite.SuiteClasses({TestClass1.class, TestClass2.class})
public class AllTests {
}
```

---

### Q: How do you use parameterized tests in JUnit?

**A:**  
Parameterized tests allow you to run the same test with different input values. You can use the `@RunWith(Parameterized.class)` annotation and provide a method that returns a collection of test data.

Example:
```java
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.junit.runners.Parameterized;

@RunWith(Parameterized.class)
public class ParameterizedTest {
    private int input;
    private int expected;

    public ParameterizedTest(int input, int expected) {
        this.input = input;
        this.expected = expected;
    }

    @Parameterized.Parameters
    public static Collection<Object[]> data() {
        return Arrays.asList(new Object[][] {
            { 1, 2 },
            { 2, 3 },
            { 3, 4 }
        });
    }

    @Test
    public void testAddition() {
        assertEquals(expected, input + 1);
    }
}
```

### Q: What are some best practices for writing JUnit tests?

**A:**  
- Write clear and descriptive test names.
- Keep tests independent and isolated.
- Use setup and teardown methods to manage test state.
- Test both positive and negative scenarios.
- Use assertions effectively to validate behavior.
- Regularly run tests and integrate them into the build process.

### Q: How do you run JUnit tests in an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse?

**A:**
You can run JUnit tests directly from the IDE by right-clicking on the test class or method and selecting "Run" or "Debug." Most IDEs provide built-in support for JUnit, allowing you to view test results, coverage, and debug tests easily.
