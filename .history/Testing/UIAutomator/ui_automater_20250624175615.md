### Q: What is UI Automator?

**A:**  
UI Automator is a testing framework provided by Android that allows you to write automated UI tests for Android applications and the system UI. It lets you interact with visible elements on the device, even across different apps.

### Q: What are the main features of UI Automator?

**A:**  
- Ability to interact with multiple apps and system UI elements.
- Cross-app functional UI testing.
- Supports testing on real devices and emulators.
- Offers a powerful API for finding and interacting with UI components.

### Q: How does UI Automator differ from Espresso?

**A:**  
Espresso is designed for testing within a single app’s context and has access to the app’s internals, whereas UI Automator can interact with and automate UI across multiple apps and the Android system UI. UI Automator is suitable for end-to-end scenarios, while Espresso is best for unit and integration tests within one app.

### Q: How do you locate UI elements using UI Automator?

**A:**  
UI Automator provides `UiSelector` and `UiObject` classes to locate UI elements by attributes such as text, resource ID, class name, or description. For example:
```java
UiObject button = mDevice.findObject(new UiSelector().text("OK"));
```

---

### Q: How do you run UI Automator tests?

**A:**  
UI Automator tests are written as JUnit test cases. They can be executed using the Android Studio test runner, the command line with `adb shell am instrument`, or via continuous integration tools.

---

### Q: What is UiDevice in UI Automator?

**A:**  
`UiDevice` is a class that provides access to the device and allows you to perform actions such as pressing buttons, opening notifications, or interacting with the overall device UI.

---

### Q: Can UI Automator interact with system apps and notifications?

**A:**  
Yes, UI Automator can interact with system apps, notifications, and other apps, making it suitable for testing complex app workflows that span multiple apps or system components.

---

### Q: What are some limitations of UI Automator?

**A:**  
- Slower than in-app testing frameworks like Espresso.
- Limited access to app internals.
- May require device-specific adjustments for stability.
- UI changes (like localization or layout changes) can affect test reliability.

---

### Q: How would you handle dynamic UI elements in UI Automator tests?

**A:**  
Use flexible selectors (like resource ID, partial text, or class name) and include waits (e.g., `UiAutomator.waitForExists()`) to ensure elements are present before interacting with them.

---

### Q: How can you integrate UI Automator tests into a CI/CD pipeline?

**A:**  
You can execute UI Automator tests on emulators or physical devices as part of a CI/CD build process using command line tools or plugins (like Gradle, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions) to automate test execution and reporting.
