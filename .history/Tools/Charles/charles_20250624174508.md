### Q: What is Charles Proxy and why is it used in mobile app development?

**A:**  
Charles Proxy is a web debugging proxy application that allows developers to view all the HTTP and HTTPS traffic between their computer (or mobile device) and the Internet. It is commonly used in mobile app development for debugging API calls, inspecting network requests and responses, simulating different network conditions, and modifying requests or responses for testing purposes.

### Q: How do you configure a mobile device to use Charles Proxy?

**A:**  
To configure a mobile device to use Charles Proxy:
1. Connect the device to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer running Charles.
2. Find your computer’s IP address and set it as the HTTP proxy in your device’s Wi-Fi settings, using port 8888 (default).
3. If inspecting HTTPS traffic, install the Charles SSL certificate on the device.
4. Start capturing traffic in Charles and verify that requests from the device appear in Charles.

### Q: How does Charles Proxy help debug HTTPS traffic?

**A:**  
Charles Proxy enables HTTPS traffic debugging by using SSL Proxying. After installing Charles’s SSL certificate on the device and trusting it, Charles can decrypt and display the contents of secure requests and responses, allowing developers to inspect headers, payloads, and debug issues with secure APIs.

### Q: What are some common use cases for Charles Proxy in mobile development?

**A:**  
- Debugging network calls and APIs.
- Analyzing and replaying requests.
- Simulating network throttling (slow/fast connections).
- Editing requests/responses to test error scenarios.
- Mocking API responses.
- Capturing logs for bug reporting.

### Q: How do you set up SSL Proxying in Charles Proxy?

**A:**  
1. Go to Proxy > SSL Proxying Settings in Charles.
2. Enable SSL Proxying.
3. Add the host(s) and port(s) you want to proxy (e.g., *:443 for all HTTPS traffic).
4. Install and trust the Charles Root Certificate on your device.
5. Charles will now decrypt and display SSL traffic for those hosts.

### Q: How can you mock API responses using Charles Proxy?

**A:**  
You can mock API responses using the Map Local or Map Remote features:
- **Map Local:** Redirects a request to a local file, allowing you to serve custom responses.
- **Map Remote:** Redirects a request to a different remote server.
Set up the mapping in Charles’s Tools menu, then trigger the relevant request from your app to see the mocked response.

### Q: What are some alternatives to Charles Proxy?

**A:**  
- Fiddler
- mitmproxy
- Proxyman (macOS)
- Wireshark (for packet-level analysis)

### Q: What are the security considerations when using Charles Proxy?

**A:**  
- Only install the Charles SSL certificate on test devices, not on production devices.
- Be cautious when proxying sensitive information.
- Remove the Charles certificate after testing to avoid security risks.
- Never intercept traffic for apps that handle confidential data unless you have permission.
