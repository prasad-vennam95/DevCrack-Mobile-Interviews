### Q: What is Git and why is it used in software development?

**A:**  
Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage project history. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously and provides tools for branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.

---

### Q: What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

**A:**  
Git is a version control tool used locally to manage code history, while GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration features such as pull requests, issue tracking, and code reviews.

---

### Q: Explain the difference between git fetch and git pull

**A:**  
git fetch downloads changes from a remote repository but does not merge them into your local branch. git pull does both: it fetches changes from the remote and immediately merges them into your current branch.

---

### Q: What is a branch in Git and why are branches useful?

**A:**  
A branch in Git is a separate line of development. Branches allow developers to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation without affecting the main codebase. Once work is complete, branches can be merged back into the main branch.

---

### Q: How do you resolve a merge conflict in Git?

**A:**  
When Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches, a merge conflict occurs. To resolve it, open the conflicting file(s), look for conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>), manually edit and choose the correct code, then add and commit the resolved files.

---

### Q: What is the purpose of .gitignore?

**A:**  
.gitignore is a file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore in a project. This is useful for excluding build artifacts, dependencies, sensitive data, or files that should not be tracked by version control.

---

### Q: How can you revert a commit that has already been pushed to a remote repository?

**A:**  
You can use git revert <commit_hash> to create a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit. This is safer than git reset for public branches, as it preserves history.

---

### Q: What is a pull request and how is it used?

**A:**  
A pull request (PR) is a feature on platforms like GitHub that allows developers to propose changes from one branch to another (commonly from a feature branch to main). PRs enable code review, discussion, and approval before merging changes.

---

### Q: What is the difference between git merge and git rebase?

**A:**  
git merge combines changes from one branch into another, preserving the history of both branches. git rebase moves or combines commits from one branch onto another, resulting in a linear history but rewriting commit hashes.

---

### Q: How do you undo the last commit in Git?

**A:**  

- To undo the last commit but keep the changes locally: git reset --soft HEAD~1
- To undo the last commit and discard changes: git reset --hard HEAD~1

---

### Q: How do you clone a repository from GitHub?

**A:**  
Use the command: git clone <repository_url>

---

### Q: What is a detached HEAD state in Git?

**A:**  
A detached HEAD occurs when you checkout a commit that is not a branch tip. Any changes made in this state are not associated with a branch and may be lost unless a new branch is created.

---

### Q: How can you see the commit history in Git?

**A:**  
You can view the commit history using the command: git log. This displays a list of commits with their hashes, authors, dates, and commit messages. You can also use options like `--oneline` for a more concise view or `--graph` to visualize the branch structure
---

### Q: What is the purpose of the git stash command?

**A:**  
The git stash command temporarily saves changes in your working directory that are not ready to be committed. It allows you to switch branches or pull changes without committing your current work. You can later apply the stashed changes using git stash apply or git stash pop.

### Q: How do you create a new branch in Git?

**A:**
You can create a new branch using the command: git branch <branch_name>. To switch to the new branch, use git checkout <branch_name> or combine both actions with git checkout -b <branch_name>
---

### Q: What is the purpose of the git tag command?

**A:**  
The git tag command is used to create, list, delete, or verify tags in Git. Tags are references to specific commits and are often used to mark release points (v1.0, v2.0, etc.) in the project history. Unlike branches, tags do not change and are meant to be permanent markers.

### Q: How do you view the differences between commits in Git?

---

**A:**
You can view the differences between commits using the command: git diff <commit1> <commit2>. This shows the changes made between the two specified commits. If you want to see changes in your working directory compared to the last commit, use git diff HEAD.


### Q: What is the purpose of the git remote command?

**A:**

The git remote command is used to manage remote repositories. It allows you to add, remove, and view remote connections. Common commands include git remote add <name> <url> to add a new remote, and git remote -v to list all remotes with their URLs.
